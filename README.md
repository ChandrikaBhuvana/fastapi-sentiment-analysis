# 🎬 IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis API

This project uses machine learning to classify IMDB movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**. The model is served through a **FastAPI** application with interactive Swagger documentation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Logistic Regression classifier trained on cleaned IMDB reviews  
- ✅ Text preprocessing with TF-IDF vectorization  
- ✅ FastAPI-based REST API with request validation (Pydantic)  
- ✅ Interactive Swagger UI for testing  
- ✅ Clean and modular project structure  
- ✅ Local deployment with Uvicorn
